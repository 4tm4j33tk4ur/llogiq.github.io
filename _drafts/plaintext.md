title: Plain Text Reigns Supreme
---

Now and then, I stumble over people lamenting that our programs are still restricted by plain text when other means would be better. As a reference for future discussions, I'm writing down my argument why this is wrong here.

# Inertia

I'm bringing this first because it is the strawman every proponent of non-textual format drags out to be shot. *Surely once we start doing something to promote better formats, streams of bytes will take some time to vanish, but vanish it will*... well, no, but nice try.

# Tools / Interoperability

This goes beyond plain inertia: Plain text keeps things interoperable. We can have tools that work regardless of language, because the medium they all rely on is plain text. While some tools are available that enrich the underlying plain text with additional information (e.g. types, scopes, control flow, etc.) to provide functionality, note that this information is *implicit* in the text – it can be recomputed any time. Tools that work on plain text tend to work well together – see the usual UNIX suspects for a demonstration of the priniciple.

# Robustness

It's no surprise the internet runs on plain text protocols. Not only because to transfer stuff over the network, you have to serialize it into a stream of bytes.

Plain text formats are extremely robust. With a non-textual format, when your file gets corrupted, you lose the whole thing. With plain text, you can look into it to see what's wrong, and probably fix it.

# Keyboards vs. mouse

[Fitt's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitt's_Law) postulates a lower bound for the time to target a UI element using a pointing device, no matter if you are using a mouse, touchpad, trackpad, trackball or other device. On the other hand, trained touch typists (and good programmers usually are) type words without paying attention to the act of typing due to [muscle memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory). This also means that given enough training it is possible to type code *faster than thinking it up*.

In short, the keyboard is still the fastest way to transfer thoughts from the brain to the computer. Even though the usual keyboard layout [was created to slow down typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwerty) (and some programmers are moving to alternatives like Dvorak), there hasn't been any sufficiently strong contender during the last decades (and it wasn't for lack of trying [citation needed]).
