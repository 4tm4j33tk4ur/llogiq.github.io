title: My Rust Story
---

The #rustreach project is apparently asking people how they got into Rust, and though I wasn't
asked in person, I thought it may be useful to write down my personal Rust story. Here goes
nothing.

I like programming languages. I even wrote my own very unsuccessful one as part of my diploma
thesis. It predictably went nowhere and I quickly lost interest. However a certain fascination for
programming languages stayed with me. So when I heard of Rust, I decided to take a short look on
the project. My [first encounter] dates back to June 2014: I opened an issue with a suggestion to
create a "Zen of Rust" document, which was quickly and rightfully closed as irrelevant.

I note that this date saw the deprecation of the `str::from_utf8_owned` method. The Rust version du
jour was `0.12.0-pre`. Development was a lot slower than now; only a few select people were active.
I decided to keep my vantage point and look from afar at Rust. It would take until March 2015
before I interacted a second time with the project (I added another alternative to a RFC), and this
time my PR was accepted.

Bolstered by this initial success, I decided to take a deep dive and started the "extra_lints"
project on March 19, 2015. What better way to learn a language than to write lints for it in
itself? The first lint, `eq_op`, which has survived to this day, although with significant changes,
was added short four days later. A few more lints (and weeks) later, [@ctjhoa] opened an issue
suggesting I merge my project with [Manish Goregaokar]'s "[rust-clippy]", which had a few different
lints.

So Manish and I joined forces and I became the first co-maintainer. I proceeded to write a rather
large number of lints for clippy. Also, since I found our tests wanting, I started to go hunting
for real-world codebases to test clippy on, which lead to a rather large number of pull requests to
more than a hundred projects. As for clippy, you probably know how that story turned out.

On the third of June 2015, I wrote my first RFC, called "target version", which was closed after
about 50 comments. I note with some satisfaction that the RFC very much describes the same concept
as [#2052 Epochs] (now renamed to "edition").

Just a day later, I wrote my first blog post about Rust, specifically how to write lints for it. I
remember a discussion with Manish that we should have something like that, so I went ahead and
wrote it. A bit more than a month later, I published [Holy std::borrow::Cow] to great reception on
[/r/rust], so I wrote a [redux]. Numerous posts about benchmarking, profiling, type shenanigans and
various other topics later, I'm one of rust-learning's "famous bloggers" and my Rust-Java
comparison has been plagiarized.

My second crate, [optional] was created due the fact that Rust at that time lacked enum determinant
optimization, which made types like `Option<bool>` or `Option<f32>` larger than need be. This is
now mostly moot, but the crate is still in use (and may still bring performance benefits on some
workloads).

My first successful RFC was [#1270 deprecated for everyone], committed on September 5, 2015.
Thanks to this, we now can evolve our APIs without fear of sudden breakage. My second successful
RFC from May 2016 allowed eliding `'static` lifetimes in `const` and `static` items; I am proud to
say I implemented it myself, awesomely mentored by Niko Matsakis. During that time I also
contributed to the Rust [benchmarksgame] entries.

In November 2015 Hanno Braun organized the Rhein-Main Rust meetup, and I have attended most of the
meetups, as well as being a co-organizer for some time.

In December 2015 I joined [This Week in Rust], by following through on my suggestion to add a
"crate of the week", to signal-boost well-written, useful crates. I accepted the task of compiling
the list of notable changes later, which I have kept up to this day.

Around May 2016, I became interested in procedural macros, and to quench my curiosity, I wrote
[flamer] and later [overflower] (which marks my first use of specialization). In September,
nerd-sniped by a comment Raph Levien left in his [xi] editor's rope crate, I started the
[bytecount] crate for high-perf byte counting. It's used in various projects, notably xi and
[ripgrep], which use it for screaming fast newline counting.

Around that time, my third child was born, so I somewhat reduced my involvement in the Rust
community all through 2017. I still found the time to attend RustFest Kyiv and [speak] at RustFest
Zurich. I'm currently preparing to emcee RustFest Paris.

Some weeks ago I've started the [mutagen] project, trying to replicate Manish's project maintenance
structure with some modest success (It's now my most-starred project on github). This is very much
a research project, and I should probably go back to Uni and write a paper about it. Alas, I have a
full-time job and three kids, so that'll have to wait.

All this stuff might come off as bragging, so let me explain that I would certainly not have been
this successful were it not for the Rust language and community. The strictness and footgun-freedom
of the compiler let me write code that I wouldn't have managed in other languages, and indeed not
all my attempts of porting Rust code to Java have been successful. Also I haven't done much of
anything by myself: The most successful projects owe a lot to capable co-maintainers and
contributors.

So looking back, what made me join and identify with the Rust community? The openness and
helpfulness, the great (and [fun, too]) discussions, the high distribution of awesome people in the
community and also the language and tooling. I feel that my profession needs something like Rust
(and secretly hope it will be superceded by something even more awesome), to lift up folks even if
they don't use it, just by pushing the boundary of what is deemed practical, or even possible.
