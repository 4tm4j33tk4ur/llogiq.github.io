title: Holy std::borrow::Cow!
---

Recently I got into a 
[reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3cl12r/is_rust_too_complicated/csxee09?context=3) 
about how lifetimes are in fact quite hard. Not having had to deal with 
lifetimes and ownership so far within clippy, because just about 
everything we use is already owned by the compiler, I did not have much 
of an opinion about lifetimes, when user The_Doculope stated:

> This is where lifetime elision bites us in the ass.

(/u/The_Doculope on [/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust))

Needless to say I was shocked!

(me on [/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust))

Right after writing this, I happened upon a source line in clippy I 
wasn't quite happy with, because it cloned a string (with 
`.to_string()`! blasphemy!) just to use it in a `&format(…)`. Now this 
was in a `Result<String, …>::unpack_or(…)`, so I first tried to wrangle 
the lifetimes of an owned string against a given string, to no avail.

Alas, it was all for naught. I could not give an owned string the same
lifetime as a string borrowed from the compiler, which promptly told me
so in not quite uncertain terms.

I will spare you the gory error messages, as I'm sure if you have 
written code like this in Rust, you will already know them, and 
otherwise, well, it's not so bad anyway:

Luckily I remembered that handy `std::borrow::Cow`, and rewriting the 
snippet with it (and `std::convert::From`) was a piece of cake. I even 
created a `fn` to make it reusable, thus I now have officially written 
my first lifetime annotation on a method. [*ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED*]

For the interested, the function is:

```Rust
pub fn snippet<'a>(cx: &Context, span: Span, default: &'a str) -> Cow<'a, str> {
    cx.sess().codemap().span_to_snippet(span).map(From::from).unwrap_or(Cow::Borrowed(default))
}
```
