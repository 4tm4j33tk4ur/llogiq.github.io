title: 2015-2016 Retrospective
---

Now that 2016 is coming to an end, I feel like looking back on the stuff I've
written so far, mostly about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), but also
touching other topics like
[Fedora 23 LXDE Spin](https://llogiq.github.io/2016/05/21/fedora.html),
[Java Code Golf](https://llogiq.github.io/2016/03/09/java-golf.html) or
[Plain Text Supremacy](https://llogiq.github.io/2015/09/14/plaintext.html).

I wrote a lot more than I had anticipated when I started in April 2015 – 51
entries so far containing more than 49k words totalling over 320k bytes. I
have been linked from [rust-learning](https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning)
multiple times and I'm honored to have my
[Rust/Java comparison](https://llogiq.github.io/2016/02/28/java-rust.html)
[plagiarized](https://llogiq.github.io/2016/07/20/famous.html) on
JaxEnter.com, prompting me to donate my writing on this blog to the public
domain.

My personal favorite entry is [Holy
`std::borrow::Cow`](https://llogiq.github.io/2015/07/09/cow.html) (+
[Redux](https://llogiq.github.io/2015/07/10/cow-redux.html)), both for the
usefulness of `Cow` and the cheesy detective story in the Redux. Those were
quite short (at least initially), so perhaps I should write more short
articles. I remember being egged on by
[carols10cents](https://reddit.com/user/carols10cents) to write it, in spite of
my feeling that it was too trivial to warrant a blog post.

I'm most embarrased by my [take](https://llogiq.github.io/2016/02/10/code.html)
on Code of Conducts, which spawned a *very* lively, at times nasty discussion.
Still, I stand by my point – that we should reach out to and try for empathy
towards those who are opposed to our (or even any!) code of conduct, rather
than shaming and shunning them, because alienating people is inherently
incompatible with convincing them. The recent US election seems to support my
argument rather well.

Rust has matured considerably during the approximately two years I've been
following it. We got the `?` operator, `catch_unwind` and a slew of stabilized
APIs. I did my part with the
[deprecation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1270-deprecation.md) and
[static contsts](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1623-static.md)
RFCs, not to mention working on [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy),
[This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org),
[bytecount](https://github.com/llogiq/bytecount)
[overflower](https://github.com/llogiq/overflower) and a number of other
projects including a large number of drive-by PRs after testing clippy on most
code bases I could find. I also moderate the
[/r/rust](https://reddit.com/r/rust) subreddit and help organize Meetups in the
Rhein-Main area.

I'm very happy to be part of the
[awesome](https://llogiq.github.io/2016/04/23/awesome.html) Rust community.
Most notably my hat's off to (in alphabetical order, and I probably forgot to
mention some. Sorry) [Alex Chrichton](https://github.com/alexchrichton),
[Andrew Gallant](http://burntsushi.net), [bluss](https://github.com/bluss),
[Florian Gilcher](http://skade.me), [Hanno Braun](http://hannobraun.de),
[Joshua Landau](https://github.com/Veedrac),
[Manish Goregaokar](https://manishearth.github.io),
[Niko Matsakis](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps).
[Paho Lurie-Gregg](http://paholg.com),
[Pascal Hertleif](https://pascalhertleif.de),
[Ty Overby](http://tyoverby.com/),
[Vincent Esche](https://github.com/regexident).

Looking forward, 2017 will prove an interesting year in more than one way. With
the political theatre in turmoil, many nations seemingly veering into facism,
powerful interests subverting the systems that make the web a force for our
personal freedom, we're in dire need of some safety guarantees that don't ask
us to give up our freedom first. Here's to hope that Rust can help regain some
of that safety.
