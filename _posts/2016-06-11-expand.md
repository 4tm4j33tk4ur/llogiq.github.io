title: Procedural Macros vs. Macros
---

*I'm using `rustc 1.11.0-nightly (915b003e3 2016-06-02)` for this post*

Starting not [one](https://github.com/llogiq/flamer), but 
[two](https://github.com/llogiq/overflower) projects revolving around
procedural macros is a great way to learn a thing or two about them. One thing
that bugged me was that they didn't work easily when the code that should be
manipulated involved macros. Luckily, stackoverflow user ker 
[helped me out](http://stackoverflow.com/a/37673678/2765603), and I wanted to
share the technique here.

The idea is that we don't care about macros – we *do* care about the expanded
code coming out of it. Macros we care about can appear in `Item` position and
in `Expr` position. For both, we want to expand the macros and apply whatever
transformation we implement on the resulting `Expr`s or `Item`s.

Without further ado, here's the code:

```rust
impl<'a, 'cx> Folder for Overflower<'a, 'cx> {
    fn fold_item(&mut self, item: P<Item>) -> SmallVector<P<Item>> {
        if let ItemKind::Mac(_) = item.node {
            let expanded = expand_item(item, &mut self.cx.expander());
            expanded.into_iter()
                    .flat_map(|i| self.fold_item(i).into_iter())
                    .collect()
        } else {
            fold::noop_fold_item(item, self)
        }
    }
    
    fn fold_expr(&mut self, expr: P<Expr>) -> P<Expr> {
        if self.mode == Mode::DontCare { return expr; }
        if let ExprKind::Mac(_) = expr.node {
            let expanded = expand_expr(expr.unwrap(), &mut self.cx.expander());
            self.fold_expr(expanded)
        } else {
            ..
        }
    }
    ..
}
```

Of course, if we'd like to change items, we'd use our own code instead of
`fold::noop_fold_item(..)`. In other news, overflower is now beginning to be
somewhat usable – I'll need to add a bit of documentation, but the code itself
seems to work pretty well.
