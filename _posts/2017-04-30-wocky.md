(with apologies to Lewis Caroll)

'Twas C++, the slithy structs
did gyre and gimble the namespace
all virtual were the function calls
and the templates disgraced

"Beware use-after-free, my son,
the jaws that byte, the segs that fault,
beware thread-unsafety and shun
the UB by default".

He took a vorpal Rust in hand,
long time the template foe he sought
so rested he by the red-black-tree
and sat there deep in thought.

And as in OO thought he stood,
use-after-free, with graphs of flame
came whiffling through the random wood
and burbled as it came!

One-two! one-two! And done TODO!
The vorpal Rust went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
he went compiling back.

"And hast thou slain use-after-free?
Come to my heart, my beamish boy!
"Oh, frabjous day! Calloo, callay!"
he chortled in his joy.

'Twas Rust now, and the slithy structs
had impls many for each trait,
generic methods, such constucts
were monomorphized straight.
