title: Closures as Anti-Lifetime-Rectal-Bite-Device
---

[Remember](
when reddit user [TheDoculope](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheDoculope) 
warned me that "*lifetime elision bites us in the ass*"? It recently didn't 
happen, but only narrowly, and today I want to share you the device I used to
enact my escape: Closures.

# The problem

Let's say we want to do something with a borrow, but we need to get it first.
So we write a function `get_borrowed_foo(..)` that gets us the needed `foo`.
This will however not work, we will get an error (example modified from real
code to protect the guilty):

```
src/foo.rs:548:30: 548:82 error: borrowed value does not live long enough
src/foo.rs:548                 &path.segments[0].identifier.name.as_str()
                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
note: in expansion of if let expansion
src/foo.rs:546:9: 550:10 note: expansion site
src/foo.rs:545:59: 552:6 note: reference must be valid for the lifetime 't as defined on the block at 545:58...
src/foo.rs:545     ...lots of code here...
```

So what can we do? We cannot return a borrow, because we somehow have to get
it back! But we do have a way of wrapping a function so that we can return
our borrow afterwards: Closures.

Instead of `get_borrowed_foo(..)`, we write a `with_borrowed_foo(..)` method,
like:

```Rust
fn with_borrowed_foo<F, T>(path: &Path, f: F) -> T
where F: FnOnce(&Foo) -> T {
  f(&path.segments[0].identifier.name.as_str())
}
```

Now we can call it with just about any closure that takes an immutable 
reference to a `Foo` and returns whatever, wrapping it in our 
`with`-function will 'lift' it to work on `&Path` instead of `&Foo`.

Note that I haven't invented the technique, I just stole it from
the `syntax::codemap::CodeMap::with_expn_info(..)` function.
