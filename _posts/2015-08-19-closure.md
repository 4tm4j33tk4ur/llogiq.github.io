title: Closures as Anti-Lifetime-Gluteal-Bite-Device

[Remember](/2015/07/09/cow.html)
when reddit user [The_Doculope](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Doculope) 
warned me that "*lifetime elision bites us in the ass*"? It recently didn't 
happen, but only narrowly, and today I want to share you the device I used to
enact my escape: Closures.

# The problem

Let's say we want to do something with a borrow, but we need to get it first.
So we write a function `get_borrowed_foo(..)` that gets us the needed `foo`.
This will however not work, we will get an error (example modified from real
code to protect the guilty):

```
src/foo.rs:548:30: 548:82 error: borrowed value does not live long enough
src/foo.rs:548                 &path.segments[0].identifier.name.as_str()
                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
note: in expansion of if let expansion
src/foo.rs:546:9: 550:10 note: expansion site
src/foo.rs:545:59: 552:6 note: reference must be valid for the lifetime 't as defined on the block at 545:58...
src/foo.rs:545     ...lots of code here...
```

So what can we do? We cannot `return` the borrow here, because its lifetime 
is tied to something we cannot control. But we do have a way of wrapping a 
function so that we can freely use our borrow within our function: Closures.

Instead of `get_borrowed_foo(..)`, we write a `with_borrowed_foo(..)` method,
like:

```rust
fn with_borrowed_foo<F, T>(path: &Path, f: F) -> T
where F: FnOnce(&Foo) -> T {
  f(&path.segments[0].identifier.name.as_str())
}
```

Now we can call it with just about any closure that takes an immutable 
reference to a `Foo` and returns whatever, wrapping it in our 
`with`-function will 'lift' it to work on `&Path` instead of `&Foo`.

Note that I haven't invented the technique, I just stole it from
the `syntax::codemap::CodeMap::with_expn_info(..)` function.

**Bonus**: Redditor SimonSapin had 
[a great solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3hotge/blog_closures_as_antilifetimerectalbitedevice/cu9aqt4)
involving explicit lifetimes which unfortunately turned out not to work. 
Yet. A similar solution may however work to solve related problems in 
other circumstances.

I also should note that I recently came across some more scary-looking
lifetime errors, which came *after* a simple erroneous statement that
closed a scope early. So if you see lifetime errors, don't blindly grab
a closure, look if there are other errors and fix them first.
